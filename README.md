# Project Title: Used Car Inspection System with Car Scanner

1. Overview: The demand for used cars is becoming the norm in today’s society as prices for new cars are skyrocketing. According to Popli (2021), the average new-car price hit $41,044 in July, a jump of 17%. One of the factors that determine the value of a used car is its inspection report. Our client, Geely, has a 3D car exterior scanner which is capable of thoroughly checking a used car and generating quantitative data on said car’s condition. However, due to the convolution of the data generated and the fact that not all used car customers are well versed in the inner workings of a car, there exists an information gap between the customers and the sellers. Hence, our group was tasked by Geely to develop a software that is able to display the comparisons results of used cars to bridge the informational gap that may only intensify with the introduction of their 3D scanner.
